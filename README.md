Repository tracking source code for COSC3500 coursework, as completed in Semester 2, 2023.

### Assigment

The assignment implements fast multiplication of large square matrices using all of: serial techniques, AVX, openMP, MPI and CUDA.

### Project

The project implements Conway's Game of Life in three stages:

- Naive solution: maintained on the `proj-unoptimized` branch

- Serially-optimised solution: maintained on the `proj-serially-optimized` branch

- Parallelised solution: maintained on the `main` branch

_NOTE: All branches contain the latest assignment implementation._
